Every config should work. Made the feature "ListAllPaterns" mandatory because it makes sense... :) 

FeatureIDE does not bring any fun at all. It extremely slows down eclipse.
When opening config files, I have to wait several minutes until I can work with them.
Copy&Paste of config files and feature model does not work.
Strange symbols in front of java files.
When I remove FeatureIDE from my eclipse/use an eclipse without FeatureIDE, eclipse behaves as expected (not extremely fast, but fast).
I'm on Ubuntu 15.10 with eclipse Mars.2 Release (4.5.2) and FeatureIDE is version 3.0.1.201605191759.
